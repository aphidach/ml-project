## Project Overview

This is an interactive web application that creates a festive particle system using p5.js and ML5.js, designed to generate a dynamic Christmas-themed visual experience.

## Features

- üåü Interactive particle generation
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowfall effect
- üé® Gradient text animation
- üñ•Ô∏è Responsive design
- üéÅ Customizable particle system

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- p5.js
- ML5.js

## Prerequisites

- Modern web browser
- Webcam for hand pose detection
- Good lighting conditions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aphidach/ml-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ml-project
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Usage

- Position your hand in front of the webcam
- Move your hand to generate and interact with particles
- Watch as particles spawn and move based on your hand's position
